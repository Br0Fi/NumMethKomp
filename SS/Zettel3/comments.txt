part1.py solves the first part of the task.
The three gifs nu0, nu1 and nu2 show that the stiffness increases as nu decreases.
For nu=0.003 and smaller we get an overflow error in line 37.

part2.py solves the second part of the task.
N=256 and N=128 looks fine without dealising.
N=64 gives strange numeric effects without dealising for t>500 (N64.gif).
Dealising makes it way worse and causes invalid value errors.
